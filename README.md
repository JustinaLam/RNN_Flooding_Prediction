# RNN_Flooding_Prediction
LSTM Recurrent Neural Network using Tensorflow, Keras, and Sklearn to predict urban flooding, particularly in Fanno Creek, OR

Uses time series data from the USGS database, including precipitation and weather information as well as measured water levels at regular time intervals.

Data and results were later visualized on a web application using Flask and HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
